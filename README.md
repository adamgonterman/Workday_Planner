# Workday_Planner

## Description

I created an application that allows the user to schedule events throughout their workday to help manage time and stay on top of the things they need to get done. The application allows the user to make updates to their calendar real-time and keep track of what is now in the past, present and future.

## Installation

Pull from my public github repository (https://github.com/adamgonterman/Workday_Planner) and clone on your local machine to create a directory that allows you to run the code yourself! You can also access the application at the following URL: https://adamgonterman.github.io/Workday_Planner/ .  

## Usage

I have included a screenshot of the application below.
